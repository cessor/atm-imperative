# ATM Example

As an example, I coded this little ATM. It uses an imperative coding style with a "Top To Bottom" Layout. 
Check out the "refactoring" branch, by using 

    $ git checkout refactoring
    
In this branch, I replaced the imperativ for-loops with list comprehensions, to illustrate the concept. 

Known Issues: 
 - Breaks when entering non-digits when asking for amount
